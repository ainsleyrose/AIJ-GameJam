## "Guess the number!"

Here I will be explaining my journey through my coding experience for this project!

* Took some ideas to learn from Khan Academy to kick-start my project
* Started thinking of a game that I can launch within my learning bounderies
* Thought about making a "Guess the Number" game
* Used what I know from CSS to styling the page, HTML to put things together, and JavaScript to create functions and instructions
* Came through few errors such as not knowing what to do next and typos
* Used Khan Academy and it's forum and Google to help me think of properties I've forgotten and how to solve common errors
